Generate line unit tests using the following criteria:
- Test coverage for reasonable input, output, edge cases, and exceptions.
- Include mocks where needed.
- Tests should have clear, descriptive method names.
- Test comments should be included when complexity warrants it.
- Do not assume there are public getters and setters unless found in the source code
- Imports in the source code do not indicate that the method being tested needs the dependency
